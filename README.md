singer-tools
============

Tools for working with Singer Taps and Targets

* `singer-check-tap` - validates Tap output
* `singer-infer-schema` - infers a json-schema from Tap output
* `singer-release` - for Singer projects that are written in Python, deploy packages to PyPi
* `diff-jsonl` - diffs two JSONL files, such as those produced by a tap

Installation
============

`singer-tools` should be installed into and run from a dedicated virtualenv to avoid version
conflicts with the tap it's operating on.

1. Create and activate a virtualenv
2. `pip install -e .` (for developing `singer-tools`) or `pip install singer-tools` (for running `singer-tools`)
3. Run via `<virtualenv>/bin/<singer-tool>`, e.g. `<virtualenv>/bin/singer-check-tap`.

Tools

singer-check-tap
----------------

You can use `singer-check-tap` to check whether a Tap conforms to the
Singer specification.

### Checking a tap

If you run `singer-check-tap` and provide a path to a Tap (with the
`--tap` option) and a configuration for that Tap, it will do the following:

1. Run the tap with the specified config and no `--state` option
2. Validate the output the tap produces
3. Check the exit status of the tap
4. Capture the final state produced by the Tap and save it to a file
5. Run the tap again, this time with a `--state` arg pointing to the final state produced by the first invocation
6. Validate the output the tap produces
7. Check the exit status

If all of the invocations of the Tap succeed (exit with status 0) and if
the output of the Tap conforms to the specification, this program will
exit with status 0. If any of the invocations of the Tap fail (exit
non-zero) or produce output that does not conform to the specification,
this program will print an error message and exit with a non-zero status.

### Checking output of a tap

Sometimes it's convenient to validate the output of a tap, rather have
`singer-check-tap` actually run the tap. You can do that by omitting the
`--tap` argument and providing the Tap output on STDIN. For example:

```bash
my-tap --config config.json | singer-check-tap
```

In this mode of operation, `singer-check-tap` will just validate the data
on stdin and exit with a status of zero if it's valid or non-zero
otherwise.

### Sample data

You can try `singer-check-tap` out on the data in the `samples` directory.

#### A good run:

```
$ singer-check-tap < samples/fixerio-valid-initial.json
Checking stdin for valid Singer-formatted data
The output is valid.
It contained 17 messages for 1 streams.

      1 schema messages
     15 record messages
      1 state messages

Details by stream:
+---------------+---------+---------+
| stream        | records | schemas |
+---------------+---------+---------+
| exchange_rate | 15      | 1       |
+---------------+---------+---------+
```

#### A bad run:

```
$ singer-check-tap < samples/fixerio-invalid-no-key-properties.json 
Checking stdin for valid Singer-formatted data

```

singer-infer-schema
-------------------

If the data source you're using does not publish a schema, you can use
`infer-schema` to parse a sample of JSON-formatted data and produce a
basic schema.

```bash
$ singer-infer-schema < data.json > schema.json
```

You should not consider the resulting schema to be complete. It's only
intended to be a starting point, and will likely require manual editing.
But it's probably easier than writing a schema from scratch.

singer-release
--------------

For Singer projects that are written in Python, you should use
`singer-release` to deploy packages to PyPi. This script confirms that
your changes are up-to-date with `origin/master`, tags the release, and
then deploys it to PyPi. To run it, just run `singer-release` from the
root directory of a Singer project that has a `setup.py` file. This script
will do the following:

1. Parses the version number from `setup.py`
2. Confirms that you are on the master branch
3. Confirms that your git working directory and index are clean
4. Does a `git push`
5. Tags the repo with the version number
6. Pushes the tags with `git push --tags`
7. `python setup.py sdist upload`

Note that `singer-release` _does not_ change the version number. You must
edit `setup.py` and set the version number manually and commit the change
before running `singer-release`.

diff-jsonl
----------

When you make a change to a tap, you want some confidence that you're not introducing a regression. So, it's helpful to be able to diff the output of tap jobs. The `diff-jsonl` tool diffs two JSONL files, such as those produced by a tap:

```diff
$ diff-jsonl data-on-master.jsonl data-on-branch.jsonl
*** data-on-master.jsonl

--- data-on-branch.jsonl
